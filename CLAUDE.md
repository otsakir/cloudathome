# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**CloudAtHome** enables home-hosted application servers to be reachable from the internet via a cloud proxy. The cloud server component manages SSH reverse tunnels and HAProxy routing rules. The home server component (in `home/`) connects to the cloud server to register and establish tunnels.

## Running & Building

All services run via Docker Compose from the `cloud/` directory:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose -f cloud/compose.yaml up --build

# Start individual services
docker compose -f cloud/compose.yaml up tunnelagent
docker compose -f cloud/compose.yaml up haproxy
```

### Django (local development, outside Docker)

```bash
cd cloud/src
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run dev server
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run a specific test module
python manage.py test homes.tests

# Migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=cloudserver.settings.local_settings` for local dev (SQLite, DEBUG=True). Docker uses `cloudserver.settings.docker_settings`.

In local dev `HAPROXY_ENABLED=False` so HAProxy calls are skipped silently.

### Home management script (requires sudo)

```bash
sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py add <suffix> <home_id> -p <pubkey_file>
sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py remove <suffix> <home_id>
sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py update-key <suffix> <home_id> -p <pubkey_file>
sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py reload

sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py bandwidth set <home_id> --rate <kbps>
sudo python cloud/src/homes/tunnels/manage_home.py bandwidth unset <home_id>
```

`add` and `remove` do not reload sshd automatically; `reload` must be called separately (as `ElevatedOperations` in `services.py` does). `remove` also cleans up any bandwidth limit for the home.

## Architecture

### Components

| Component | Port(s) | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **HAProxy** (cloud proxy) | 443 (HTTPS), 9999 (Runtime API) | SNI-based HTTPS ingress; routes traffic to per-home SSH tunnel ports via map file |
| **Django** (Django + sshd) | 8000 (API), 8022 (SSH) | REST API for managing homes/proxy mappings; SSH server that accepts reverse tunnels from home networks |

### Request & tunnel flow

1. A home network registers by `POST /api/homes/` with its SSH public key.
2. Django calls `ElevatedOperations.add_home_user()` (in `homes/services.py`), which sudo-executes `manage_home.py`.
3. `manage_home.py` creates a system user (`home<ID>_<username>`), installs the SSH key, and configures per-user `sshd` restrictions (TCP-forward only, no TTY/shell, allowed port range 2000–2099).
4. The home network's gateway opens an SSH reverse tunnel on the assigned port.
5. The home calls `POST /api/homes/<slug>/proxy-mappings/` with a hostname and scheme. The cloud allocates a free port from the home's range, updates the HAProxy map via the Runtime API, and returns the allocated port. No mapping state is persisted in the cloud database.
6. HAProxy routes incoming HTTPS traffic by SNI hostname to the matching tunnel backend.

### Key design points

- **Privilege separation**: Django runs as the unprivileged `django` user. Tunnel management requires root; it is invoked via a tightly scoped sudoers rule (`/etc/sudoers.d/tunneling`) that permits only the `manage_home.py` script.
- **Port allocation**: Each home slot gets a block of 10 ports starting at `2000 + (home_index * 100)`.
- **Max homes**: 10 (indices 0–9), enforced in the `Home` model.
- **Username format**: `home<XX>_<django_username>` (e.g. `home00_alice`). The Django username is the SSH suffix.
- **Public keys** are staged to `/var/tunnelagent/public_keys/` before being passed to `manage_home.py`.
- **HAProxy routing**: 100 tunnel backends are pre-created in `haproxy.cfg` (one per port, ports 2000–2009, 2100–2109, … 2900–2909). SNI hostname → backend name mappings are stored in `sni_backends.map` and updated at runtime via the HAProxy Runtime API on port 9999. The maps start empty on each container start; homes are responsible for re-registering their mappings after a restart.
- **Home ownership**: `Home.user` is a FK to Django's `User` with `PROTECT` — a user cannot be deleted while they have assigned homes.

### REST API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/homes/` | List caller's assigned homes (auth required) |
| POST | `/api/homes/` | Claim a home slot and install SSH key |
| DELETE | `/api/homes/<slug>/` | Release a home slot |
| GET | `/api/homes/<slug>/proxy-mappings/` | List caller's active HAProxy mappings |
| POST | `/api/homes/<slug>/proxy-mappings/` | Allocate a tunnel port and register in HAProxy |
| DELETE | `/api/homes/<slug>/proxy-mappings/<host>/` | Remove a forwarding rule from HAProxy |
| GET | `/api/admin/proxy-mappings/haproxy` | Dump current live HAProxy map entries (admin only) |
| POST | `/api/admin/homes/sync` | Reconcile DB homes with system users (admin only) |

Authentication is session-based or token-based. All endpoints require a logged-in user. Proxy mappings are scoped to the caller's own home slot.
